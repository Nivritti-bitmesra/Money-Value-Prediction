## Predicting the exchange rate of US Dollar.
This is a project just to illustrate the power of Functional Link Artificail Neural Network (FLANN) in predicting thw Exchange rate of US Dollar.
The expansion functions used are :-
 ### x, sin(pi*x),sin(2*pi*x), cos(pi*x) and cos(2*pi*x).
Least Mean Square algorithm is used to update the weights. I have also uploaded the processed data in txt format. 70% data is used for training purpose and 30% for testing. 

Thank you.
